    st.write('''
    - **Provenance**:
        - **Eurostat Data**: Sourced from the official European Union statistical office, providing reliable and standardized trade data.
        - **State Agency Data**: Datasets from Armenia, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan are sourced from their respective national statistical agencies. However, these agencies often do not provide detailed metadata or clear licensing information, which poses challenges for data integration and reuse.
    - **Typology**:
        - The datasets include both **quantitative data** (trade values) and **categorical data** (countries, trade direction).
        - **Variations in Variables**: While Eurostat data includes detailed variables like product categories (HS codes) and monthly periods, the state agency data often provides aggregated yearly data without detailed breakdowns.
    - **Format**:
        - **Eurostat**: Data is provided in CSV format, which is widely accepted and easy to process.
        - **State Agencies**: Data is provided in various formats such as XLSX (Excel) and CSV, sometimes with inconsistent structures.
    - **Metadata and License**:
        - **Eurostat**: Provides comprehensive metadata specifying variables, units, and licensing terms under the [European Commission Reuse Policy](https://ec.europa.eu/info/legal-notice_en#reuse).
        - **State Agencies**:
            - **Lack of Metadata**: Armenia, Russia, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan do not provide detailed metadata with their datasets.
            - **Licensing Uncertainties**: Not all datasets from these agencies specify licensing terms, which raises concerns about legal reuse. For example, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan do not have clear license information.
        - **Implications**:
            - The absence of metadata requires additional effort to understand and process the data correctly.
            - Unspecified licenses necessitate cautious use of the data, adhering to fair use principles and ensuring proper attribution where possible.

            - This requires careful currency conversion and unit adjustments to ensure accurate comparisons.
        - **Inconsistent Country Names**:
            - In the Eurostat dataset for certain years (e.g., 2016), country names are listed in different languages or spellings (e.g., 'Ouzbekistan' for Uzbekistan, 'Kirghizistan' for Kyrgyzstan, 'ArmÃ©nie' for Armenia).
            - These inconsistencies caused issues during data processing, necessitating the standardization of country names to maintain consistency across datasets.
        - **Data Reliability**:
            - While Eurostat data is assumed to be highly reliable due to standardized collection methods, the accuracy of state agency data may vary due to differences in data collection practices and potential political influences.
    - **Consistency**:
        - **Standardization Efforts**:
            - Variable names and data formats have been standardized across datasets to facilitate integration.
            - Date formats have been unified, and numeric values have been converted to consistent units and currencies.
        - **Challenges**:
            - Lack of metadata from state agencies required manual inspection to understand variable meanings and units.
            - Inconsistent data structures and file formats added complexity to the data cleaning process.
